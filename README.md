REACTMAN
========
Reactman is a CLI code generation tool which will take multiple templates,
populate them, and then move them into your codebase.

Reactman's mission is to increase productivity and have your teams codebase
look like it was authored by one heroic developer.

Reactman works alone, he doesn't need a global install and works on the
command line with NPM scripts.
